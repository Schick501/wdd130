        [INTRO
        Welcome to the wonderful world of Church communication—a dynamic, fast-paced part of the global Church. Serving on a Church communication council can be very rewarding. Through your efforts, you will learn new skills, engage with wonderful people, and counsel together with other council members to create and implement strategic plans
        
        OVERVIEW
        Stake communication work is supervised by the stake president or one of his counselors, who helps establish local communication goals. These include relationships with local key opinion leaders, service in the community, humanitarian donations, and engaging in interfaith conversations and messaging to an external and sometimes internal audience. The support network for stake communication councils is the national or coordinating council communication council, which provides expertise, support, and training.
        
        AREAS OF FOCUS
        Communication councils have two main areas of focus: outreach to opinion leaders and communicating positive messages. Collaborating as a communication council is important.
        
        Outreach
        Building relationships is a focus of Church communication councils. Council volunteers are trained in the importance of establishing connections with government representatives, community leaders, media leaders of other faiths, and academic leaders. Building mutually beneficial key relationships opens doors to understanding, friendship, and willingness to learn about our beliefs and practices. Building these relationships is not missionary work. Relationships with those not of our faith are invaluable to the Church and its members. As relationships are forged, attitudes on both sides are changed and common ground is discovered. These efforts narrow the gap of misperceptions about the Church, its doctrine, and its members. The work of Church communication councils often softens the ground for missionary work or other important priorities of the Church.
        Outreach opportunities allow members of the stake communication council to represent the stake president and the global Church to local opinion leaders whose influence is generally within stake boundaries.
        Welcome to the wonderful world of Church communication—a dynamic, fast-paced part of the global Church. Serving on a Church communication council can be very rewarding. Through your efforts, you will learn new skills, engage with wonderful people, and counsel together with other council members to create and implement strategic plans.
        Examples of stake outreach activities include:
          
        Sharing official Church statements.
        Supporting global Church initiatives such as #LightTheWorld, Easter, general conferences, and #givethanks campaigns, as well as initiatives created by the Church Communication Department and area or coordinating council initiatives.
        When asked, providing meeting opportunities for visiting senior Church leaders with local opinion leaders.
        As assigned, supporting the Church Communication Department and the Temple Communication Committee with groundbreaking events and opinion leader open houses.
        Advocating for community service opportunities, using JustServe in countries where available.
        Identifying humanitarian opportunities that support stake, coordinating or national council, area, and Church priorities.
        Supporting Church disaster relief outreach efforts.
        Connecting community needs with Church-offered resources.
        Hosting events, such as a family history fair or an interfaith Christmas concert.
        Participating in community activities.
        Managing stake social media properties.
        Providing training and support for members to share their testimonies and faith-affirming experiences via social media.
        Participating in approved interfaith associations.
        Through these outreach opportunities, the stake communication council can:
          
        Facilitate relationships between the stake president and community influencers.
        Help others understand the global Church and tenets of our faith.	
        Demonstrate the commitment of Latter-day Saints to follow Jesus Christ.	
        Promote religious freedom for all.	
        Clarify misperceptions.	
        Promote trust and understanding.
        Identify shared goals and how we can work together with the community.
        Prepare proposals for stake outreach events, activities and initiatives.
        Encourage positive social media conversations.
        Share practical applications for living the doctrine of Christ.
        Strengthen the communities through promoting and participating in community service.
        External and Internal Messaging
        Communication councils deliver key messages to opinion leaders, communities, and Church members. Priesthood leaders guide these strategic communications. There are several ways that the council can assist the stake presidency with messaging:
          
        Communication planning.
        Developing relationships with media representatives and media markets within the stake.
        Creating press releases and inviting reporters to write about the Church, including events and stories of local Latter-day Saints.
        Providing messaging expertise, such as writing letters and emails to opinion leaders.
        Managing stake digital channels, such as social media, websites, or online listings for Church buildings.	
        Sharing messages from Church leaders as needed.	
        Training members on using social media to share the gospel.	
        Communicating with Church members on subjects such as local service opportunities, welfare, temple and family history activities, and Face to Face and other special devotionals for selected audiences such as children, youth, and young adults.
        Composing notes of welcome, congratulations, condolence, or gratitude to local government, faith leaders, or other opinion leaders.

      <h3>[Roles and Responsibilities]</h3>
      <p>
        [HELPFUL SKILLS AND QUALITIES
        The basic qualifications for service in Church communication are similar to other callings. However, some helpful skills and qualities are especially relevant to communication councils. Visit this article for more information.
        ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
        Below is the recommended structure when resources allow, along with examples of roles and responsibilities for various council positions. In locations where the Church is newly established, you may need to adjust this structure until membership increases and there are enough experienced members to fill additional callings.

      <h3>[Let the Spirit Guid]</h3>
      <p>
        [LET THE SPIRIT GUIDE
        Regardless of your skills and knowledge, you have been set apart to perform the roles and responsibilities of your calling. The most important thing you can do is listen to the Holy Ghost and follow the Lord's guidance. The Spirit will testify of your role in bringing the Church out of obscurity and helping inform public opinion.
        This is the Lord's work
        "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths" (Proverbs 3:5–6).
        You may feel overwhelmed. There is no pressure to do everything at once. You will grow into this calling, and you will feel the Savior guiding you along the way.
        Be prepared
        In all of these efforts, we can trust in the great promises of the Lord. He has taught us, "If ye are prepared ye shall not fear" (Doctrine and Covenants 38:30). He has also taught us that He does not ask anything of us except He prepares the way for us to accomplish it (see 1 Nephi 3:7).
        Receive training and regularly attend council meetings
        Prayerfully study the training materials, taking note of the promptings you receive. Discuss these with the council's director or priesthood leader if you are the director.
        Together, decide on a few simple priority tasks where you can focus your efforts. Set goals, create a plan, and take the necessary steps to follow through. Add more tasks as you learn of additional needs or accomplish your goals. You will become aware of opportunities as you pray for the Lord’s guidance. You will find that the more you engage in your calling, the more opportunities you will have.
        Surround yourself with praiseworthy things
        Study your scriptures daily and listen to uplifting general conference talks, hymns, and other daily activities that keep you close to the Lord.
        Small steps can lead to great results
        Get involved in your community. As you interact with others, you will have opportunities to build relationships and embrace people of other faiths. As you serve in your community, you will meet many others who have the same goal to love one another. You will become aware of opportunities to represent the Church and match Church resources with needs.
        Be confident in your efforts to serve
        Your efforts will bear fruit. Be mindful that Church communication is laying the foundation for future growth, and you may not see immediate results for your efforts.
        The good news is that when we do the Lord's work in the Lord's way, we are assured of His blessings to help us"I will go before your face," He has said. "I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up." (Doctrine and Covenants 84:88)
        FINAL THOUGHTS
        The account of Nephi's endeavor to obtain the brass plates serves as a inspiring paradigm for our own pursuits as communication councils. While the narrative outlines the "what," the precise "how" is not given.
        
        Nephi's resolute declaration, "I will go and do" (1 Nephi 3:7), encapsulates his commitment to the Lord's directive. The initial endeavor to secure the plates from Laban proved unsuccessful (1 Nephi 3:15), prompting a reassessment and a second attempt, which brought significant challenges in it’s failure (1 Nephi 3:25). 
        Throughout these trials, Nephi clung to his faith, relying on the guidance of the Spirit. In his final attempt he expresses this faith and willingness to follow the Lord, "I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do. Nevertheless, I went forth..." (1 Nephi 4:6-7). It was after all of these steps that he finally achieved success.
        
        While we know the Lord could have bestowed immediate success upon Nephi, the intricate paths he traversed were designed for his personal growth and progression.
        
        
        In our undertakings as communication councils, success may not materialize immediately—whether on the first, second, or even third attempt. Yet, take solace in the realization that you tread a path familiar to many who came before you. By consistently seeking the Spirit in all your endeavors, you will ultimately fulfill His work.
