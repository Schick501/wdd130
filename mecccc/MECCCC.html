Including relationships with local key opinion leaders, service in the community, humanitarian donations, and engaging in interfaith conversations and messaging to an external and sometimes internal audience. Local Coordinating Council Communication Councils provide expertise, support, and training.</h2>

                <h4>Council volunteers are trained in the importance of establishing connections and building mutually beneficial key relationships. Building these relationships is not missionary work. Relationships with those not of our faith are invaluable to the Church, prompting changes in attitude and misprections about the Church, its doctrine, and its members. Communication Councils deliver key messages externally to opinion leader and communities, and internally to Church members. Priesthood leaders guide these strategic communications.</h4>
