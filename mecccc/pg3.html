                <h1>Overview (left)
                    Regardless of your skills and knowledge, you have been set apart to perform the roles and responsibilities of your calling. The most important thing you can do is listen to the Holy Ghost and follow the Lord's guidance. The Spirit will testify of your role in bringing the Church out of obscurity and helping inform public opinion.

                    "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths" (Proverbs 3:5–6).
                    You may feel overwhelmed. There is no pressure to do everything at once. You will grow into this calling, and you will feel the Savior guiding you along the way.

                <h3>Be prepared
                    In all of these efforts, we can trust in the great promises of the Lord. He has taught us, "If ye are prepared ye shall not fear" (Doctrine and Covenants 38:30). He has also taught us that He does not ask anything of us except He prepares the way for us to accomplish it (see 1 Nephi 3:7).

                <h4>Receive training and regularly attend council meetings
                    Prayerfully study the training materials, taking note of the promptings you receive. Discuss these with the council's director or priesthood leader if you are the director. Set goals, create a plan, and take the necessary steps to follow through adjusting as needed. The more you pray for the Lord’s help and engage in your calling, the more opportunities you will have.

                <p>Be confident in your efforts to serve
                    Your efforts will bear fruit. Be mindful that Church communication is laying the foundation for future growth, and you may not see immediate results for your efforts. When we do the Lord's work in the Lord's way, we are assured of His blessings to help us "I will go before your face," He has said. "I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up." (Doctrine and Covenants 84:88)
